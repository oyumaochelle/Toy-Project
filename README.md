Student Grade Generator
This simple JavaScript script calculates and assigns grades based on user-inputted student marks. The grade scale is defined as follows:

A: Marks greater than 79
B: Marks between 60 and 79
C: Marks between 50 and 59
D: Marks between 40 and 49
E: Marks less than 40
Function
calculateGrade(mark)
This function takes a numerical input representing a student's mark and returns the corresponding grade based on the defined grade scale. It includes validation to ensure that the input is a number within the valid range of 0 to 100.

Usage
To use the script, call the calculateGrade function and pass the student's mark as an argument. The script will output the corresponding grade. If the input is invalid, it will display an error message.

javascript
Copy code
console.log(calculateGrade(85)); // Output: A
console.log(calculateGrade(68)); // Output: B
console.log(calculateGrade(53)); // Output: C
console.log(calculateGrade(45)); // Output: D
console.log(calculateGrade(30)); // Output: E
Note
Marks must be numerical values between 0 and 100.
The script is designed to handle invalid inputs gracefully, providing an error message.
Feel free to integrate this script into your projects or modify it according to your needs. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
